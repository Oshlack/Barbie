Title: Analyze Barcode Data from Clonal Tracking Experiments
Version: 0.99.0
Description: The Barbie package provides a suite of robust statistical tools 
  for analysing Barcode count data generated from clonal tracking experiments.
  By tracking the incorporation of unique DNA Barcodes into progenitor cells 
  and sequencing the Barcodes from progeny cells, researchers can quantify 
  clonal populations and assess their dynamics before and after experimental 
  perturbations. Barbie covers data preprocessing, statistical testing, and 
  visualizations.
